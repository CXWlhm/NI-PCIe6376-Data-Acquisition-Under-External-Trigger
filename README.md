# NI-PCIe6376-Data-Acquisition-Under-External-Trigger
A program used to data acquisition based on NI-PCIe-6376 DAU coupled with BNC-2110 BNC adapter, as well as the post-process tool in MATLAB code.

The LabVIEW code "PCIe_6376_Data_Acquisition_Cui.vi" is used to drive the NI-PCIe-6376 DAQ card. In the code, the rising-edge triggering signal is imported through the PFI 0 port of the BNC-2110 adapter. By default, eight channels work at Â± 10V range. Ofcourse the range can be changed as required. The delay time is set as 30s by default. 

The path of the gereated data file is the path where the LabVIEW code is located and the file type is .dat. The name of the genreated data file consists of three important parameters: the time when the file is gernerated, the frequency at which the data is sampled and the number of the pre-trigger points. For example, '20190701_123030_3500000HZ_2000Pre.dat' means the data is sampled at 12:30:30 am on July 1st 2019 at 3.5MHz sampling frequency with 2000 pre-trigger sampling points.
